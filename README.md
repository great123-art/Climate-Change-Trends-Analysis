Climate Change Trends Analysis
Overview
This project analyzes global climate change trends using historical weather data from publicly available sources. We explore temperature, precipitation, and CO2 level changes over the decades to identify patterns, seasonal variations, anomalies, and forecast future trends.

The project involves:

Data collection and cleaning

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Time series analysis and anomaly detection

Forecasting future climate trends

Interactive visualizations and reporting

Dataset
The primary data sources used are:

NOAA Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN)

NASA GISS Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP)

Other climate-related datasets from Kaggle or open government portals

Features
Data cleaning and preprocessing

Visualizations of climate variables over time

Seasonal trend decomposition

Anomaly detection of extreme weather events

Forecasting using ARIMA and Prophet models

Interactive plots with Plotly/Dash

Requirements
Python 3.8+

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

statsmodels

fbprophet (Prophet)

plotly

jupyter

Future Work
Expand datasets to include more regions and variables for a comprehensive climate analysis.

Improve forecasting models by integrating advanced deep learning approaches like LSTM or Transformer-based time series models.

Develop a fully interactive and user-friendly dashboard using frameworks such as Dash or Streamlit to visualize climate trends dynamically.
